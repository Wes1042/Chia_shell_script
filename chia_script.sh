Find_space()
# Find total amount of space there is and display how much space you have left which will calculate how much space we can use 

Parallel_plotting(chia_command)
# if user typed yes then the program will run in the command with multiple shells . Will open other shells 
Maybe open screen 

Check_venv()
# if user is not in venv mode (will have trouble figuring this out ) activate the block chain activate directory  and run 

Set_directories() 
# sets the temporary directory and final destination 

Get_input()
# gets input of the user and can be used multiple times
